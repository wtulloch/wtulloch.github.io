## So sue me
Okay so I am probably a bit a late to the party but just found this library for documenting Angular projects called [Compodoc](https://compodoc.github.io/compodoc/).

In all it took about 15 minutes to get up an running on an existing project. The great thing with it allows you to step back from the code and get a sense of the bigger picture.
