## Preamble

I have been an inconsistent web developer. Starting with ASP classic in the '90s and through to early to ASP.NET I then moved into application development, Silverlight (those were the days), back-end development, etc., etc. Since becoming a consultant this has become even more pronounced. This also meant that every time I returned to web development there was a raft of new things I had to learn.
