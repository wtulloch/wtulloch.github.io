## Preamble

I have been an inconsistent web developer. Starting with ASP classic in the '90s and through to early to ASP.NET I then moved into application development, Silverlight (those were the days), back-end development, etc., etc. Since becoming a consultant this has become even more pronounced. This also meant that every time I returned to web development there was a raft of new things I had to learn.

Prior to late last year (2016), the last serious web project I worked on used Angular 1.x where the focus was on the MV* pattern. After that I was off on other coding adventures. In that time React became a thing and there were rumblings about Angular2 but you know, other things.

Then in the last quarter of last year I ended up in Madrid working on a project that was based on Google Polymer. 

Up to that I point I hadn't heard of Polymer or considered the component-based approach to web development (with the exception of swearing at AngularJS directives) but straight off the bat it felt right and I took a shine to Polymer and it's approach.
